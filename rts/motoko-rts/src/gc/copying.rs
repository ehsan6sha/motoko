/// already evacuated end_to_space is not changed.
///
/// Arguments:
///
/// - begin_from_space: Where the dynamic heap starts. Used for two things:
///
///   - An object is static if its address is below this value. These objects either don't point to
///     dynamic heap, or are listed in static_roots array. Objects in static_roots are scavenged
///     separately in `evac_static_roots` below. So we skip these objects here.
///
///   - After all objects are evacuated we move to-space to from-space, to be able to do that the
///     pointers need to point to their (eventual) locations in from-space, which is calculated with
///     `end_to_space - begin_to_space + begin_from_space`.
///
/// - begin_to_space: Where to-space starts. See above for how this is used.
///
/// - end_to_space: Where the object in `ptr_loc` will be copied.
///
/// - ptr_loc: Location of the object to evacuate, e.g. an object field address.
